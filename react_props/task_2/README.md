0. Basic components
   mandatory
   Start with your files from the last task of the React intro project

Instead of creating new elements, weâ€™re going to create components to split the project. The App.jsx is going to become the main entry point, the shell, for every component in the app.

Create a Header component
Create a new folder Header:

Create a functional component Header inside the Header.jsx where you move the code of the header from the App.jsx.
Move the CSS code, related to the header, from the App.css to a new file named Header.css.
Create an empty test file Header.spec.js.
Create a Footer component
Create a new folder Footer:

Create a functional component Footer inside the Footer.jsx where you move the code of the footer from the App.jsx.
Move the CSS code, related to the footer, from the App.css to a new file named Footer.css
Create an empty test file Footer.spec.js.
Create a Login component
Create a new folder Login:

Create a functional component Login inside the Login.jsx where you move the code of the login form from the App.jsx.
Move the CSS code, related to the login, from the App.css to a new file named Login.css
Create an empty test file Login.spec.js.
Modify the shell
In the App.jsx:

Along with the Notifications component, import the Header, the Login, and the Footer components
Pass the components in the above order respectively
Wrap the above elements inside a react <Fragment>
Tests:

In the App.spec.js:

As an entry point, in the App.spec.js file, check that all components are rendered correctly
In the Header.spec.js:

Copy all Header related unit tests within the Header.spec.js file
In the Login.spec.js:

Copy all Login related unit tests within the Login.spec.js file
In the Footer.spec.js:

Copy all Footer related unit tests within the Footer.spec.js file
Requirements:

At this point, reloading the App should display the exact same page as the last task
The console in your browser should not show any errors or warnings
